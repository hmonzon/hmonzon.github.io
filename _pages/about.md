Hugo is a Postdoctoral Researcher at [Adaptive Bayesian Intelligence Team](https://adaptive-bayesian.ai/). 
He obtained his Computer Engineering Degree from [Universidad Nacional de Asuncion](https://www.una.py/english) in 2014. 
From 2015 to 2017 thanks to a MEXT Scholarship he pursueed a master degree in the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at [Shinshu University](https://www.shinshu-u.ac.jp/english/), 
and from 2017 to 2021 a doctoral degree at the Department of System Development and Mathematics. 

His interest is using evolutionary algorithms and machine learning to develop methods for AI4Science, designing models that not only are accurate, but robust, explainable, fair, and can be trusted. 
To accomplish it, he is introducing a multi-objective approach based on his previous research, in order to create models with desirable trade-offs between conflicting goals and tasks.
